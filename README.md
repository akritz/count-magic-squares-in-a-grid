# count-magic-squares-in-a-grid
Given an Grid of integers. The task is to find total numbers of 3 x 3 (contiguous) Magic Square subgrids in the given grid. A Magic square is a 3 x 3 grid filled with all distinct numbers from 1 to 9 such that each row, column, and both diagonals have equal sum.

Examples:

Input: G = { { 4, 3, 8, 4 }, { 9, 5, 1, 9 }, { 2, 7, 6, 2 } }
Output: 1
Explanation: The following subgrid is a 3 x 3 magic square: [ 4 3 8, 9 5 1, 2 7 6 ]



Input : G = { { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }, { 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 }, { 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 }, { 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 } }
Output : 0
